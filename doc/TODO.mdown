#2 views/posts/show
Back link doesn't go to the appropriate page (kaminari pagination)

#4 controllers/application :require_user
Needs to redirect back to the same page and highlight the login box. Currently :store_location fucks up and gets .../comments for the current URL on some pages, cos the comments model is called as part of the posts/show view etc.

#5 views/tags/form or /models/tag
Make tags save as separate entities when they're separated by spaces

# stop /user/nonexistentuser/ erroring out. Need "user not found" page
