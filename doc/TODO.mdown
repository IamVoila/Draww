#2 views/posts/show
Back link doesn't go to the appropriate page (kaminari pagination)

#3 views/layous/application
"My Worrk" should link to user posts page (see 1)

#4 controllers/application :require_user
Needs to redirect back to the same page and highlight the login box. Currently :store_location fucks up and gets .../comments for the current URL on some pages, cos the comments model is called as part of the posts/show view etc.

#5 views/tags/form or /models/tag
Make tags save as separate entities when they're separated by spaces

#6 routes
Get /users/username to work:
better than /users/userid/posts and can't it be a helper wotsit like user_posts_path(@user) or something?
