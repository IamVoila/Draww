/*
 * This is a manifest file that'll automatically include all the stylesheets available in this directory
 * and any sub-directories. You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at
 * the top of the compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new file per style scope.
 *
 * Note:
 * This is 'Sprockets' stuff. We're not using 'require_tree .' now as the load order was wrong
 * and the CSS for canvas editing is included only conditionally
 *= require_self
 *= require boilerplate
 *= require jquery-ui.aristo
 *= require unified

 * These ones won't be included
 *
 * require scaffolds
 * require global
 * require home
 * require posts
 * require comments
 * require users
